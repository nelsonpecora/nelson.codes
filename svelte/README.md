# nelson.codes

This is the repo for my personal website. It's mostly static content, but I wanted to try out [svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/) and its all-in-one framework, [sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/).

## Layout

* Homepage — A good splash page is still useful, even in the post-postmodern web. This shows off the latest cool stuff I've built, along with my old portfolio of client projects.
* Resume — I want to experiment with different portrayals of "resume" information, since the web is much more flexible than a greyscale piece of printer paper. Currently the resume is heavily inspired by [twine games](https://twinery.org/).
* That's it! — personal websites should be lean and mean.

## Development

Github builds and deploys to Github Pages when pushing to `main`.
